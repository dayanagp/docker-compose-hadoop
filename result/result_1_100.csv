96,96,"This Pokémon's moves all act as if they were normal-type.

Moves that inflict typeless damage do so as usual.  Moves of variable type, such as hidden power, are affected.  They otherwise work as usual, however; weather ball, for example, is always forced to be Normal, but it still has doubled power and looks different during weather.

As thunder wave is prevented by immunities, unlike most non-damaging moves, it does not affect ghost-type Pokémon under the effect of this ability.",en,Makes the Pokémon's moves all act normal-type.
97,97,"This Pokémon inflicts triple damage with critical hits, rather than the usual double damage.",en,Strengthens critical hits to inflict 3× damage rather than 2×.
98,98,"This Pokémon is immune to damage not directly caused by a move.

For example, this Pokémon takes no damage from from weather, recoil, status ailments, or spikes, but it still suffers from the Attack cut when burned, and a life orb will still power up this Pokémon's moves without damaging it.  Anything that directly depends on such damage will also not happen; for example, leech seed will neither hurt this Pokémon nor heal the opponent, and Pokémon with a jaboca berry or rowap berry will not consume the berry when hit by this Pokémon.

The following are unaffected: struggle, pain split (whether used by or against this Pokémon), belly drum, substitute, curse, moves that knock the user out, and damage from confusion.

This Pokémon will neither lose nor regain HP if it drains HP from a Pokémon with liquid ooze.

If this Pokémon is badly poisoned, the poison counter is still increased each turn; if the Pokémon loses this ability, it will begin taking as much damage as it would be if it had been taking increasing damage each turn.",en,Protects against damage not directly caused by a move.
99,99,"Moves used by or against this Pokémon never miss.

One-hit KO moves are unaffected.  Moves affected by this ability can hit Pokémon during the preparation turn of moves like dig or fly.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is doubled.",en,Ensures all moves used by and against the Pokémon hit.
100,100,"This Pokémon moves last within its priority bracket.

Multiple Pokémon with this ability move in order of Speed amongst themselves.

The full incense and lagging tail take precedence over this ability; that is, Pokémon with these items move after Pokémon with this ability.  Pokémon with both this ability and one of these items are delayed as much as if they had only the item.

This ability works as usual during trick room: Pokémon with this ability will move in reverse order of Speed after Pokémon without it.",en,Makes the Pokémon move last within its move's priority bracket.
